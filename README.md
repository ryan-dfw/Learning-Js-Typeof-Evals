# Learning-Js-Typeof-Evals
Check main.js first! this is the project itself; the rest are on-the-way development files i've left in for evaluation.
Main.js performs all the functions of the other files, but has them organized into one script.

Psuedocode.js is my attempt at translating the javascript to pseudocode.
Purely for fun / curiousity, i fed ChatGPT my pseudocode and asked for it to turn it into code - surprisingly, it chose javascript without being prompted to.
Minified.js is the result of my feeding Main.js to an online minification utility (also for fun/curiousity) and reinserting white spaces for readbility.
